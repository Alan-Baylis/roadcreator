# Roadcreator
A free road creation tool for unity. It's currently in early alpha

**Features:**
- Place, move and delete points to create a series of curves
- Generate roads with different width, texture and much more.
- Support for shoulders
- Options are changed per-segment which allows for more control like the road having a extra lane before a intersection
- Curve smoothing to avoid sharp turns between curves (currently buggy)
- Includes a prefab line tool to place prefabs along a series of curves

**Planned features:**
- Terrain deforming
- Intersections (T, X, Roundabouts and Triangle intersections)
For more detail about planned features and bugs see https://github.com/MCrafterzz/roadcreator/issues/1
